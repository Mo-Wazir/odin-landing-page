This is a landing page demo.

I used the flex box algorithm after finishing the foundational path at TOP,while it took me days to finally get the touch, it's def worth it.

My Motivation was solely to assessed my learning and apply it. Learning is fun, it's more fun when implemented. 

I'm working on the advance part at WCIG and docdev.

Much Love.
